                  It's come to our attention that some people visiting this site
                  might mistakenly conflate DQXabbey's affiliation with the
                  Clarity project. While some members of DQXabbey contribute to
                  DQXclarity's efforts,
                  <strong
                    >there's no affiliation between the two projects.</strong

                  DQXabbey was created solely as a repository of information
                  about the game stemming from guides and resources created by

                  While the support the abbey has garnered is certainly
                  appreciated, concerns have arisen about credit being given
                  where credit is due. To reiterate, DQXabbey is
                  <strong>NOT AFFILIATED WITH DQXCLARITY,</strong> and although
                  information pertaining to Clarity is present on the site, we
