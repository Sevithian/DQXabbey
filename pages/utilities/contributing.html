                          with the concepts and the programs themselves, then
                          come back and read the rest of the guide.

                      <br />

                      <p>
                        The first thing you might think when considering
                        translating for Clarity is
                        <em>"Do I know Japanese?"</em>, which you may or may
                        not. Regardless,
                        <strong>
                          it doesn't really matter if you do or don't </strong
                        >. There are a couple rules you need to follow, but
                        using <strong>DeepL's public translator</strong>, and/or
                        <strong> pre-existing wiki information </strong> will
                        suffice.
                        <em>
                          (Sometimes, you even get to have a little
                          improvisational fun.)
                        </em>
                      </p>

                      <img
                        src="../../images/utilities/translatingprocess.png"
                        style="width: 70%; border: 2px rgb(0, 0, 0) solid"
                      />

                      <br />

                      <p>
                        What you <strong>will need to understand</strong> is
                        byte limits. A string can only take up so many bytes
                        worth of space in memory, and
                        <strong>
                          exceeding that length will break Clarity </strong
                        >. Even worse, if that problematic string is pushed to
                        everybody with Clarity,
                        <strong>
                          it'll break their Clarity as a result.
                        </strong>
                      </p>

                      <br />

                      <p>
                        However, the general rule of thumb is actually extremely
                        simple. With very few exceptions,
                        <strong>
                          most Japanese characters take up 3 bytes per character </strong
                        >. Conversely,
                        <strong
                          >English characters take up a single byte per
                          character.</strong
                        >
                        This means that for many things in Katakana or Hiragana,
                        a direct translation will usually take up 1/3 as much
                        space.
                      </p>

                      <br />
                      <br />

                      <p>
                        <strong>However,</strong> not everything will
                        <em>be</em> in kana. In fact, you'll be dealing with a
                        LOT of Kanji. What does this mean? Well,
                        <strong>each kanji is a single character</strong>,
                        however the
                        <strong>kanji can represent an entire word</strong>.
                      </p>

                      <br />

                      <p>Take the following image for example:</p>

                      <img
                        src="../../images/utilities/kanjiexample.png"
                        style="width: 70%; border: 2px rgb(0, 0, 0) solid"
                      />

                      <br />

                      <p>
                        <strong>Sword, Claymore, and Dagger</strong> all fit as
                        translations of their kanji counterpart. <br />1 kanji =
                        3 eng characters, so no problems there.
                      </p>

                      <br />

                      <p>
                        <strong>Shield (盾)</strong> is more than 3 characters.
                        <br />If the kanji for shield consisted of two
                        characters, it wouldn't be an issue, as we'd have 6
                        bytes worth of English characters to work with. However,
                        byte restrictions forced us to improvise.
                      </p>

                      <br />

                      <p>
                        This is one of many, many, MANY examples where you have
                        to be wary of string byte size, and responsible with
                        substituting explicit translations with appropriate
                        abbreviations.
                        <strong>You will run into this a lot.</strong>

                        If you understand the section above, your next step is
                        to <strong>understand the GitHub workflow.</strong> This
                        is relatively painless, and will be explained to you
                        upon requesting access to the repository for string
                        editing. <br />If, at this point you're still interested
                        in translating strings for Clarity, reach out to

                        friends, and chances are you're (probably) also eligible
                        to work on the translation programs at a higher
                        capacity. First and foremost,
                        <strong>DQXclarity is written in Python.</strong> If
                        that didn't scare you off, good.

                        Clarity's initial developer utilized many different
                        Python libraries to develop and expand the program.
                        Among these, the most important one to take note of is
                        <strong
                          >Pymem, a library that allows you to manipulate the
                          memory of active processes.</strong
                        >
                        If you understand memory manipulation and recognize the
                        concepts that presents, great. You're far ahead of where
                        I ever was when I started working on Clarity. If not,
                        again, stay with me here;
                        <strong>It's easier than you think.</strong>

                        <strong
                          >Since Clarity primarily works through hooking into
                          active memory</strong
                        >, most features and implementation require identifying
                        a byte pattern in memory and manipulating the value of
                        whatever's there. This means finding, hooking,
                        manipulating, and injecting all of the required data.

                        If you don't, you can always find a YouTube tutorial,
                        but experimentation is at your own expense. You'll also
                        more than likely have the entirety of the Clarity dev
                        team at your disposal for insight and techniques.
