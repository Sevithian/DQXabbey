                        Dragon Quest X is the 10th mainline (yes, mainline) game
                        in the Dragon Quest series. As of 2012, it has been
                        released in Japan (and China, for a short time) to
                        various platforms and devices. The obvious difference
                        from the other 10 mainline games as of this writing,
                        however, is that it is a full-fledged MMORPG. However,
                        do not let this dissuade you. This game still is, and
                        feels very much like, a traditional Dragon Quest
                        experience. The MMO elements serve to enhance that
                        experience, rather than to water them down.

                        If you are living in the US, you simply need to download
                        the game on one of its available platforms, no VPN is
                        required. If you are not in the US, you will need to
                        connect to the game on the platform of your choice with
                        a VPN. There are many guides and tutorials on how to set
                        one up to your platform of choice.
                        <br /><br />
                        The currently supported platforms are Wii U, Nintendo
                        Switch, PS4/5, and PC.
                        <br /><br />
                        The game supports an unlimited free trial, with some
                        restrictions: the main one being that you cannot advance
                        past the end of the first expansion. If you’d like to
                        experience the entire game, you must eventually purchase
                        and subscribe to it.

                        Currently the PC version has an ongoing project of
                        translating the in-game UI/menus and a program that
                        allows for machine translation of dialogue. If you do
                        not have access to the PC version, there are alternative
                        options such as using something like Google Lens on your
                        smartphone to translate on screen text through your
                        phone’s camera. No translation is planned for the non-PC
                        versions and most likely never will be.

                        time and you find there's no installation directory on

                        At the beginning of character creation, you create a
                        human character to go through a short offline prologue
                        sequence. Once you finish that, you are able to choose a
                        race and a starting class. There are no statistical
                        differences between races, so choose whatever you like
                        best. As for starting class, that is also up to personal
                        preference, as you are able to switch classes very early
                        in the game. After choosing your race and class, you
                        begin the first part of the main story in the online
                        mode.

                        As a new player, you should mainly focus on clearing the
                        main story and unlocking different facilities. When you
                        open your menu, you’ll see a box underneath that says
                        “Walkthrough/冒険ガイド”. This will direct you to your
                        next objective. However, this will *not* always be a
                        story quest, especially in the beginning. It may be an
                        important facility unlock quest. I suggest following it
                        even if it is not a main story quest. I’ve listed below
                        a few helpful links to help with these quests.

                        will also need to

                          download and launch the game via Locale Emulator
                        </strong>
                        (download with instructions
                        <a href="https://xupefei.github.io/Locale-Emulator/"
                          >here</a

                        <strong>
                          This will assume you know how to type in Japanese with
                          romaji.

                        Beginning at level 50, you will need to intermittently
                        clear level cap quests to raise your overall level cap.
                        Don’t worry, you only need to do it once, all of your
                        vocations will have their caps increased. A list of
                        level cap quests and their level requirements can be

                          Why are my stats so low compared to other players? How
                          can I raise my stats?
                        </strong>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Leveling more than one vocation has its benefits! Each
                        class has its own distinct vocation tree (for example,
                        Warrior has the “Courage” skill tree) that is always
                        located at the bottom of their skill tree list.
                        Allocating points into these will grant passive stat
                        bonuses that look something like “Natural HP + 10”.
                        These stat bonuses affect all vocations, not just the
                        vocation you learned it on. As a new player, it’s highly
                        recommended to take advantage of Metal Slime Time
                        (described above) to level up additional vocations to
                        around level 30, as this is usually a high enough level
                        to gain enough skill points to learn all of the “Natural
                        Stat” skills for a vocation.

                          Is there crafting in this game? Can I have all

                        Unlike FFXIV where you can do every single crafting job
                        on a single character, DQX only allows
                        <strong>one</strong> crafting job per character. You’re
                        allowed to try each crafting job up to level 10, but
                        once you complete a job’s initiation quest, you will be
                        locked into that craft (with an option to reset to a
                        different one, but it is costly.) <br /><br />
                        <strong>
                          As a trial player, you may only reach level 9 with a
                          craft, so you cannot lock into one.

                        Unfortunately, unlike most other DQ games, you
                        <strong>won’t</strong> be relying on in-game shops for
                        the newest weapons and armor.
                        <strong>
                          Weapons and armor bought from shops only go up to
                          level 35 </strong
                        >, so you’ll have to find alternative methods
                        afterwards. You’ll either have to rely on the
                        <strong> Traveler’s Bazaar </strong> (this game’s
                        version of the Auction House),
                        <strong>crafting</strong>, or<strong>
                          monster drops</strong
                        >. <br /><br /><strong
                          >As a trial player, you cannot access the Traveler’s
                          Bazaar and you are very limited on crafting, so you
                          must rely on monster drops.</strong

                        At lower levels, gear isn’t as necessary as it becomes
                        at higher levels. I would shoot for upgrading gear every
                        15-20 levels. A good resource to find gear would be
                        <a href="https://dq10.i-k-e.net/item/">here.</a> You can
                        see which monsters drop the gear you’re looking for, if
                        any.
                        <strong>
                          If no monster is listed, that means it is craftable
                          only.
                        </strong>
                        You can try to find a nice person to buy one off the
                        Bazaar for you and mail it to you, if they’re willing.

                        <br />
                        Again, accessories don’t matter as much in the early
                        game as they do in the late game. There are a few decent
                        starter accessories you can get from the accessory shop
                        in Verinard and the Mini Medal vendor in Luckland. If
                        you really want to target accessories, you can search
                        them
                        <a href="https://dq10.i-k-e.net/item/acs/">here</a> and
                        see which bosses drop them. After that, it’s just a
                        matter of collecting the necessary boss cards and using
                        them in the Magic Maze.
